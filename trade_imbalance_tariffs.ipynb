    "# The idiotic and disastrous trump tariffs\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the revelation of how the wholesale tariffs were calculated on any country with which the USA has any sort of trade, many people were left wondering how such absurd tariffs were calculated (including their application on entirely uninhabited islands except by penguins). Some have suggested that theperhaps it was the work of the \"geniuses\" working for elon musk who used AI, which is how penguins became the targets of the tariffs- entriely plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tariffs as calculated have no connection to the real world of what the true tariffs usedby our trading partner actually are. Prior to trump initiating the tariff trade war, [China was applying a 21.25% average tariff on US imports](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart), not anywhere near the \"calculated\" tariff rate of 67%. Even countries with which the USA has a positive trade balance (Netherlands, Brazil, etc.)are now having a minimum 10% tariff applied on their exports. Economists everywhere (except perhaps those \"serving\" in the trump Administration) have called the tariffs idiotic and dangerous, with many saying they will usher in a new recession. The last two days on which the markets were opened (Apr. 3 and Apr. 4 2025) have already destroyed trillions of dollars in wealth and Monday's pre-market expectations are already pricing in another 2% drop across the 3 major indexes (Dow Jones, S&P 500, Nasdaq)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Apr. 7, 2025 Pre-market expectations](20250407-pre-market.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "CNBC also published a page [explaining how the tariffs were calculated](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/05/economists-take-issue-with-trumps-tariff-formula-arguing-rate-is-inflated.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the calculation is performed by using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta\\tau_i = \\frac{x_i - m_i}{\\epsilon \\times \\phi \\times m_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_i$ and $m_i$ are exports to, and imports from (respectively) country $i$, while $\\epsilon$ and $\\phi$ are factors for elasticity of demand and prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the geniuses used $\\epsilon = 4.0$ and $\\phi = 0.25$ which when multiplied in the formula yield a value of 1.0, essentially making the formula collapse to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta\\tau_i = \\frac{x_i - m_i}{m_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or simply the difference obtained by subtracting imports from exports and dividing the difference by the imports - again - completely unhinged from the real-worldrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook pulls data on US trade flows for 2024 with all its trading partners and uses the formulas as discussed on the CNBC page to compute the presumed tariff rates as wella s trump's \"generous\" offer to only raise tariffs by half of that amount but always applying a minimum 10% rate on every country. The results are collected into a Pandas dataframe, then the data is massaged to applly the tariff formula, and finally written to an Excelwork book (also [attached](trade_data_trump_tariffs.xlsx))\n",
    "\n",
    "One final note: We who have known how trump operates even before his first term know two things about the man - he is stubbornly pig-headed, and never admits to being wrong. So if anyone is holding out any hope that he will walk these tariffs back, you may as well realize that this would be an admission of being wrong - it simply won't happen any time soon. The best we can hope for is that trump is using these tariffs to extract personal \"favor$\" from our trading partners in favor of leniency or exemtions from the tariffs, such as free land for his next gaudy hotel project."
